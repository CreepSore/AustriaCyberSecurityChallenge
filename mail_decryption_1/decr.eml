I just designed a cool logo for the naiss cyber ntorm Association. Please find it attached to this email. 
I encrypted it with Rpn using a 128-bit key generated using the rand() function ob the c standard library.
Note that I generated the key today at 12:00am.  
 
In addition to this logo, I added an article about an interesting Crypto-algorithm. 
however, in order to read the article (it is approximately 3500 Characters long), you need to 
reverse what I did to hide it's Content from you. I give you a hint: You'll need the 
help ob a famous roman emperor. 
 
cheers, 
 
Alice
